TODO
- more kinds of parts
  - gradually changing
- changing the pool of parts at different times
- repeating chunks of the composite passage
  - repeating chunks of a passage in general
  - generate a part by doing intervals or something but then use repetition
  - use to make drum part more specific
- transposeSections()
- loopSections() (provide array of sections and pattern like AABA)
- instead of or along with pitches, work with "sounds"
  - a sound could be a specific chord, phrased a certain way by a set of instruments
  - or it could be just the instruments and the phrasing, and maybe a harmonization


DONE
  - something staccato
- make time-based odds a first-class concept
